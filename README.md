# Giovanna's MAGICal iOS App
The project that was decided on was an iOS NFL Trivia game.
The application was developed using SwiftUI and a Storyboard.  For a reference, we used the [following] to learn how to create the Trivia section of the game.

## Accomplishments
We concluded the session with a lot of knowledge.  Although we did not finish the application, a lot was learned on both sides being that it was also Divina's first time developing a Swift application.
The entry point of the application is a welcome page that includes an image of the NFL teams logos.  The other item that was completed was the Trivia section.

## Future Accomplishments
The Sign up page does not have any functionality, it has placeholder text, and the submit button which does direct the user to the trivia game.  It was determined that the Sign up page was going to show different items, if the user was already signed up or logged in it would show a welcome page and then redirects to the trivia game, if the user either did not have a valid session then the sign up page would be displayed. 
Another page that needs to be fixed is the Results page.  After the user completes the trivia section they are to be displayed their results.  Currently the page is not being transitioned successfully.
